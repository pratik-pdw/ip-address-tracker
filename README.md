## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

I have used flexbox along with SASS for layout. I have used Netlify's Environment Variables to hide my API Key from the React Code. I have added my twist to the app by also including regex validations for IPv4, IPv6 and Domain Address. Also I have included a animating loader written in CSS that shows up on a ongoing network request.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- React.JS
- SASS

### What I learned

I am learning to use SASS. For this challenge I tried to decompose my code as much as possible unlike what I do in my other apps. I have used mixins for my responsive media queries.
